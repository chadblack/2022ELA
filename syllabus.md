In 1492, Columbus sailed the ocean blue and discovered or destroyed, conquered
or civilized the Americas. Sixty years later, in 1552, López de Gómara, the
private secretary of Hernán Cortes, wrote, "The greatest event since the
creation of the world (excluding the incarnation and death of Him who created
it) is the discovery of the Indies [i.e. Americas]." He was, himself,
a participant the conquest of Mexico. From the very beginning, not only the
magnitude, but also the meaning of the Conquest of the Americas has been
a point of controversy and acclaim. The history of Early Latin America,
however, does not begin in October 1492. Indigenous bands and great
civilizations inhabited North and South America for more than ten thousand
years prior to the arrival of Europeans on the shores of Caribbean islands.
Thus, in this class we will concentrate on the pre-Colombian period, the
conquest period, and the ensuing three hundred years of Spanish (and to
a limited extent) Portuguese rule. The lectures will move both chronologically
and topically. We will concentrate on two key geographic areas of
examination--- central Mexico, home to the highly structured pre-Columbian
societies of the Maya and the Mexica, among many others, and later the center
of Spanish control in its northern kingdoms as the Viceroyalty of New Spain;
and, the central Andes, land of the Inca Empire and its subject polities (among
others), and home of the Viceroyalty of Peru, the center of Spanish power in
its southern kingdoms. Our class will cover a tremendous breadth of time and
territory, and as such the lectures, readings, and discussion sections are
designed to draw your critical attention to issues, including ethnicity,
gender, slavery, culture, and power, as well as the institutions and structures
that patterned native, African, and European experiences of Spanish and
Portuguese imperialism. 

# course objectives

1. To introduce students to the forces, events, and conflicts that defined the process of conquest and colonization of the Americas, including:  
   * The histories and cultures of pre-conquest state systems, particularly in central Mexico and the Andes.  
   * The historical precedents for Spanish and Portuguese expansion and conquest.  
   * The process of conquest and colonization from the perspectives of Iberian, African, and indigenous populations.  
   * The fundamental forms of institutional and cultural organization that structured daily life during the three centuries of Spanish rule.  
   * The tensions of late colonial society that let to conflict, disorder, and eventually rebellion.

2. To understand and use a variety of sources that provide the core of historical inquiry.

3. To be able to identify, understand, and critique historical argument.  
    * Historians follow a lose set of epistemological, theoretical, and evidentiary rules in their attempts to recreate the limited past that is accessible to us through our incomplete archival record. At the college level and beyond, it is your task to learn how to identify an author’s central argument and to evaluate it based on its evidence, sources, logic, and narrative.

# policies


![](http://chadblack.net/511S2012/media/images/disability.png) Qualified
students with disabilities needing appropriate academic adjustments should
contact me as soon as possible to ensure that your needs are met in a timely
manner with appropriate documentation.

**Masks:** The University is currently requiring students, faculty, and staff
to mask indoors. We will comply with this requirement. The Delta variant of
this virus is extremely contagious, with an R0 somewhere [between
5-9](https://www.sfchronicle.com/health/article/CDC-says-the-delta-variant-is-as-contagious-as-16356370.php) (one person will infect
on average 5-9 people). This turns a classroom of 100+ people into
a potentially high-risk situation. Wearing a mask for 75 minutes indoors is
a small price to pay to be back in University community.

**Attendance:** Attendance is mandatory. If you cannot attend, please email
Dr. Black or your TA ahead of time. We're not making an Inquisition into your
absences, so the reasons you can't attend are not as important as giving us the
heads up. If you have *any* symptoms or have been exposed to COVID, please do
not come to class! Just send us a quick email, and get tested.


**Deadlines:** Assignments must uploaded to Canvas by the end of the day on
which they are due. Late papers will not be accepted with out **prior
arrangement**. If you will not be able to complete an assignment on time, you
must contact me and your TA ahead of time. If you contract COVID or some other
illness, please let us know so that we can work with you.


**Cell Phones, Laptops, Zoom:** Cellphones should be put away during class.
Please do not text or post to the Group Me during class. It is very distracting
to people around you, and to the professor. Laptops may be used to take notes,
but I would ask you to seriously consider using paper instead. If you want or
need to use a laptop, please consider sitting towards the back of the room so
as to minimize distractions behind you. If we have to utilize Zoom at some
point, please practice the kind of respectful manners that I'm sure you have
become used to over the last 15 months. In class and on Zoom, I would invite
you to interrupt me with questions during lecture.

Research shows that analog note-taking improves learning. Consider having paper
with you. Based on the prevailing literature, hand note-taking-- both while
reading and in class-- leads to substantially better educational outcomes.
Consider taking notes by hand even though you'll be watching on your computer.


**Drop-in Hours**: Students are strongly encouraged to speak with me and the
TAs outside of class. The advantages include: extra help on an assignment
or preparation for exams; clarification of materials covered in lecture,
discussion of comments on your work; discussion of this or related courses.
I have an open door policy during my drop-in hours. I will be there, and you
are welcome to come by for any reason. Your TAs have the same.

**Changes:** I reserve the write to change this syllabus as the semester
progresses. This is not a contract, but rather a document to guide expectations
and clearly communicate weekly assignments. Please bring the syllabus with you
to our class meetings. Or, keep up with it on the course website. We'll have to
remain flexible as the outlook for our fourth pandemic semester is still
uncertain.
