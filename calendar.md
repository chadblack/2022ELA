## Week One: Introduction (Aug 19-21)

Welcome (back) to the History of Early Latin America. This week, your only
responsibility is to carefully read over the syllabus, the course requirements,
and to plan for you participation in class! Make sure you understand what the
coursework requirements are, and also some general recommendations on how to
read, take notes, and think about weekly material.

This is quite obviously a very lecture intensive class. Your lecture notes will
be very important for your weekly assignments. If you struggle with note-taking, or have never taken a humanities lecture
course before, you will need to think about, and put effort into improving your
note-taking. Take a look at these resources, and find a system that works best
for you:

1. [Effective Note-taking in
   Lectures](https://www.cc-seas.columbia.edu/node/31875).  
2. [The Pen is Mightier than the
   Keyboard](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0956797614524581).  
3. [How to Take Better
   Notes](https://collegeinfogeek.com/how-to-take-notes-in-college/).  

In addition to taking notes during lecture, you need to be an active
reader of the pieces we’re assigning. This means using either paper or pdf
tools to highlight and markup the assignments. We will be discussing this
over the course of the semester, especially how to approach strange texts
with unfamiliar concepts.

Your most fundamental skill for this semester will be creatively connecting the
lectures and the readings, looking for thematic similarities or arguments both
within a week's topic and between weeks. Make sure to look at each week's
title, and the brief comments comment for the week to help follow the arc of
the semester.

**Textbook Reading:** Preface: The Colonial Crucible. 


## Week Two: Premodern Societies I (Aug 24-26)

The immigrants to what we now call the Americas arrived by land and cruising the
coasts. The civilizations that evolved from their wanderings were highly
complex and advanced. We begin the semester considering their emergence, and
the revolutionary domestication of Zea mays that made it possible. To this day,
there is no single crop or animal more central to the US economy and its food
system than corn.

This week we look at commonalities among most premodern societies, and
then at the Maya.

**Textbook Reading:** Native America

**DUE: WEEKLY REPORT**


## Week Three: Premodern Societies II (Aug 31-Sep 2)

The collapse of Classical Maya society did not mean the disappearance of
the Maya. Indeed, Maya-speaking communities continue to form integral
parts of Mexican and Guatemalan society today, along with other Central
American states. This week, we consider the successors and inheritors of
the Mesoamerican cultural world once dominated by the Maya, with the rise
of the Mexica in the central valley of Mexico. Then, we turn to South
America for an introduction to the third great sedentary empire of the
pre-Conquest period, the Inka of the Andes. As you read and attend lecture
this week, consider the influence of environmental factors on the
emergence of these civilizations along with their religious and social
practices.

**DUE: WEEKLY REPORT**

## Week Four: Premodern Societies III  (Sep 7-9)

With a foundation in the pre-Conquest Americas, this week we turn to the
Iberian Peninsula, the close-in Atlantic islands, and to Africa to look at the
roots of conquest in the so-called “Old World.” Consider the culture of
conquest cultivated by Isabella and Ferdinand in the 1490s, and also what
lessons Iberians learned of conquest and expansion in their control of Atlantic
Islands and the trade in enslaved captives with West Africa.

**Textbook Reading:** Castile and Portugal; and Atlantic Africa

**DUE: WEEKLY REPORT**

## Week Five: The Early Conquest (Sep 14-16)

Prior to sailing across the Atlantic, Columbus learned from Portuguese and
Spanish expansion into the Atlantic Islands and down the coast of Africa
economic models for colonial exploitation. Conquering and enslaving native
populations, importing captive Africans for enslaved labor, cultivating
sugar for export to Europe, and improving sea-going technology were all in
place before he received Royal support. This week, we look at the
transplantation of an Atlantic model of conquest and exploitation to the
Caribbean, and at its religious critics. Pay close attention to the
arguments made by Friars Montesinos, and Pane, and whether
they offer an alternative colonial model, or an alternative to
colonialism?

**Textbook Reading:** The Iberian Imperial Dawn

**Tuesday: Caribbean Conquests**

* Christopher Columbus’s Log, excerpted in English. Focus on period after Oct. 11.

* The Requerimiento

**Thursday: The Critique**

* “The Laws of Burgos. 1512-1513”

**DUE: WEEKLY REPORT**

## Week Six: On the Mainland (Sep 21-23)

In the 1520s and 1530s, the Spanish Empire expanded to cover much of
Central and South America. At the time, Spaniards and their native allies
both imagined themselves as conquering the controlling empires of
Mesoamerica and the Andes. Who, then, conquered whom? In the early 16th
century, did native allies with the Spanish imagine themselves as
collaborators in European domination? If not, what did they imagine they
were doing?

**Textbook Reading:** Native American Empires

**Tuesday: Conquest Myths and Realities**

  five episodes so [far written and drawn at Aztec
  Empire](https://www.bigredhair.com/books/aztec-empire/episode-one/). This graphic novel
  version of the Conquest works hard to be faithful to the visual world and
  recent historical scholarship on Cortes’s march from the sea.

**Thursday: On the Planes of Cajamarca**

**DUE: Nothing. Take the week to get caught up with the middle of your
semester.**

## Week Nine: Captivity and Enslavements (Oct 12-14)

**Textbook Reading:** Black Communities

From its inception, the Spanish and Portuguese colonial projects depended on the labor of enslaved Africans. As Kris Lane argues, slave owners even pinned their hopes for the afterlife on enslaved labor after death. Pay close attention this week to strategies that enslaved and free blacks pursued in colonial Latin America.

**Tuesday: A Society Built on Slavery**

* Kris Lane, “Captivity and Redemption: Aspects of Slave Life in early Colonial Quito and Popoyan,” The Americas 57.2 (2000), 225-246.

**DUE: WEEKLY REPORT**

## Week Ten: Native Labor and Accumulation (Oct 19-21)

Enslavement was not the only form of coerced labor exploited by Iberian empires. This week we consider the effects of encomienda and tribute on the integrity of native communities under Iberian rule. What significance is there in native communities pursuing their own legal strategies before the crown? How did tribute taxation and labor function? Were the New Laws successful?

**Textbook Reading:** Native Communities

**Tuesday: The Many Kinds of Economic Coercion**

* Ward Stavig, The World of Túpac Amaru, Ch. 6.

**Thursday: Wither the Two Republics?**

**DUE: WEEKLY REPORT**

## Week Eleven: Love, Hate, and Social Reproduction (Oct 26-28)

This week, we are focusing on family, sexuality, and social order. The customs and laws of Iberia and the Indies were deeply influential in the ordering (and disordering) of colonial society. The Conquest, and its aftermath, included exploitative and coercive relationships, and even regular marriages had their fair share of conflict between spouses. This week, we consider these things by looking at unnatural sexuality and witchcraft, as a way of also understanding what colonial society understood to be natural.

**Textbook Reading:** Defining Deviancy and Daily Life in City and Country

**Tuesday: Sex in the Archive**

* Zeb Tortorici, “Impulses in the Archive: Misinscription and Voyeurism,” Chapter 2 in Sins Against Nature (Duke University Press, 2018).

**DUE: WEEKLY REPORT**

## Week Twelve: Disruption and Reform (Nov 2-4)

This week, we look at the early transformations of the colonial relationship after the Spanish War for succession. Consider the reforms posited by José Galvez, and reactions to them that fall short of open rebellion.

**Textbook Reading:** War and Reform

**Tuesday: Reacting to Reforms**

* “José de Gálvez’s Decrees for the King’s Subjects in Mexico (1769, 1778)” in Mills, et. al., Colonial Latin America, pp. 270-273.

* Pamela Voekel, “Peeing on the Palace: Bodily Resistance to Bourbon Reforms in Mexico City,” Journal of Historical Sociology, Vol. 5 No. 2 (June 1992): 183-208.

**Thursday: No class.**

Finish your film review, which must be smart, clever, and plugged in to this
semester's themes.

**DUE: FILM REVIEW**

## Week Thirteen: Rebellion and Reaction (Nov 9-11)

By the 1780s, part of the Spanish Empire erupted into open rebellion
against the economic reforms pushed afer the Seven Years War. Why did these
rebellions not lead to Independence? What explains the complicated
political identities articulated by their protagonists? What constituted
legitimate authority by century's end?

**Textbook Reading:** Late Colonial Life


**Tuesday: Opening the Age of Rebellion**

* Elizabeth Penry, “Letters of Insurrection: The Rebellion of the Communities (Charcas, 1781)” in Colonial Lives: 201-215.

**DUE: WEEKLY REPORT**

## Week Fourteen: Independence (Nov 16-18)

The crises of the Bourbon reforms never produced independence movements. That would take Napoleon invading Spain. We consider this week the crisis of 1808 caused by Napoleon, and how that set up the process of independence, which wouldn’t culminate for more than a decade!

**Textbook Reading:** Independence

**Tuesday: Did Anyone See It Coming?**
