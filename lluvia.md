# Paper instructions

This film is a lot more meta than the other two. It is set in Cochabamba,
Bolivia in the year 2000, as a film crew led by Gael García Bernal's character shoots
a film about Christopher Columbus. Daniel, the central indigenous actor for the
film, is also a leader in the Chochabamba Water War over government attempts to
privatize the municipal water systems of the country. The film contrasts the
current struggles in Bolivia with the historical struggles of indigenous people
portrayed in the Columbus film. So, you get to play around with these
temporalities, with the notion that Andean indigenous people can simply stand
in for Taínos, and with the attitudes of the crew.

Your assignment is to write a critical review of *Even the Rain* that evaluates
the historical merits of the film. In order to do this, you will need to draw
on the assigned readings from class. You must use two readings assigned
from class. (No outside readings, though. Let’s keep it focused on the
resources we’ve used in class.) Each paper should include a short overview of
the plot, the important characters, and a discussion of the historical themes
that they embody. Then, with reference to the readings, evaluate the historic
merits of the film. Analyze the readings in the context of the film, and the
film in the context of the readings.

It is up to you which historical themes you decide to emphasize from the theme, but you must be able to connect them to specifics in either the primary or secondary readings at your disposal.

Please note that this paper is to be entirely your own work. You may not use
internet resources or other outside readings. Stick to the readings that have
been assigned in class. Whenever you use ideas from those readings, whether
explicitly or not, you must cite them in footnotes. Citations should conform to
Turabian style. A guide to Turabian style citations is available
[here](https://libguides.utk.edu/c.php?g=188584&p=3122379#s-lg-box-9616961). We
will be keeping up with reviews of the film available online. The one exception
to outside-class resources available for writing this paper is the film’s page
on the Internet Movie Database, which you may only use to keep track of and
correctly spell the names of the characters.
